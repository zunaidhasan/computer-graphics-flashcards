Question,Answer
What is Computer Graphics?,"Computer Graphics is the use of computers to display and manipulate information in graphical or pictorial form, either on a visual-display unit or via a printer or plotter."
Name 4 major applications of Computer Graphics,"1. Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
2. Presentation Graphics
3. Computer Art
4. Entertainment
5. Education and Training
6. Visualization
7. Image Processing
8. Graphical User Interface (GUI)"
What is CAD in Computer Graphics?,"Computer-Aided Design - uses animations, wireframe displays, realistic lighting models and surface rendering for designing and testing vehicles, manufacturing processes, and circuit layouts."
What are Presentation Graphics?,"Graphics used for producing illustrations for reports or slides - includes bar charts, line graphs, surface graphs, pie charts, and other displays showing relationships between data."
What is the role of Computer Graphics in Entertainment?,"Used in producing computer animation for films, television, music videos, often combining live action with computer graphics scenes for special effects."
What is Visualization in Computer Graphics?,"Converting data and information into pictures to gain insight and better understanding - used in scientific, engineering, medical, and business applications."
What is Image Processing?,"Techniques applied to modify or interpret existing images - includes digitization, storage, image enhancement, and analysis. Important in medical applications."
What is a GUI?,"Graphical User Interface - a component that uses windows, icons, menus, and pointing devices for user interaction with computer systems."
What is a Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT)?,"A display device where a beam of electrons (cathode rays) emitted by an electron gun passes through focusing and deflection systems to specified positions on a phosphor-coated screen, emitting light."
Why does CRT need refresh?,"Because the light emitted by the phosphor fades very rapidly, so the picture must be redrawn repeatedly and quickly to maintain a stable image."
What is a Raster Scan Display?,A display system where the electron beam sweeps across the screen one row at a time from top to bottom. Picture information is stored in a refresh/frame buffer.
What is a Random-Scan Display?,Also called vector display - draws only the required lines/components of the picture. Picture is stored as a set of line-drawing commands in a refresh display file.
What is the typical refresh rate for displays?,60 to 80 frames per second to avoid flicker.
What are the two methods for color CRT?,"1. Beam-Penetration Method
2. Shadow-Mask Method"
Explain Beam-Penetration Method,"Uses layered phosphor (red and green). The speed of electrons determines which layer glows. Limited color range, primarily produces red and green."
Explain Shadow-Mask Method,"Uses three electron guns (one each for Red, Green, Blue) and a shadow mask with holes. Each gun illuminates specific color phosphor dots, allowing wide range of colors."
What is a Direct-View Storage Tube (DVST)?,"A display that stores picture information inside the CRT, eliminating need for refresh. Good for complex static images but cannot erase selectively - must redraw entire screen."
What are the two types of Flat-Panel Displays?,"1. Emissive Displays (convert electrical energy to light)
2. Non-Emissive Displays (use optical effects to convert light)"
Name 3 types of Emissive Displays,"1. Plasma Panel
2. Thin-Film Electroluminescent Display
3. LED (Light-Emitting Diode)"
What is a Plasma Panel?,Constructed by filling region between two glass plates with mixture of gases (neon + argon). Ionized gas emits light. Forms glowing spots at intersections.
What is LCD?,Liquid Crystal Display - a non-emissive display that uses liquid crystals to control light passage. Requires backlight or external light source.
Advantages of LED displays?,"Fast, reliable, low power consumption, long life, small size, lightweight."
Disadvantages of LCD?,"Limited viewing angle, brightness depends on external light source."
What are the 3 popular line drawing algorithms?,"1. Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Line Drawing Algorithm
2. Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm
3. Mid Point Line Drawing Algorithm"
What is DDA Algorithm?,Digital Differential Analyzer - the simplest line drawing algorithm that generates points between starting and ending coordinates of a line.
What are the initial parameters for DDA?,"ΔX = Xn - X0
ΔY = Yn - Y0
M = ΔY / ΔX (slope)"
What are the 4 cases in DDA Algorithm?,"Case 1: M < 1 → X1 = X0 + ΔX, Y1 = Y0 + M × ΔX
Case 2: M ≥ 1 → X1 = X0 + ΔY / M, Y1 = Y0 + ΔY
Case 3: M = 1 → X1 = X0 + ΔX, Y1 = Y0 + ΔY
Case 4: M undefined (vertical line)"
What is the stopping condition for DDA?,Keep repeating until end point is reached OR number of generated points equals the steps count.
Advantages of DDA Algorithm?,"1. Simple and easy to implement
2. Fast method for calculating pixel positions
3. Eliminates multiplication by using incremental calculations"
Disadvantages of DDA Algorithm?,"1. Uses floating point arithmetic (slower)
2. Requires rounding operations
3. Less accurate for circles and curves
4. Time consuming due to rounding"
What is Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm?,"An incremental scan conversion algorithm that uses ONLY integer calculations to generate line points, making it faster and more efficient than DDA."
What is the key advantage of Bresenham over DDA?,"Uses only INTEGER arithmetic (addition/subtraction) instead of floating-point operations, making it much faster."
What is the decision parameter in Bresenham?,Pk - a parameter used to decide which pixel to select next. Based on the difference between upper and lower pixel distances from the mathematical line.
Initial decision parameter for Bresenham?,P0 = 2Δy - Δx (for slope < 1)
Decision rules in Bresenham Algorithm?,"If Pk < 0: Select lower pixel, Pk+1 = Pk + 2Δy
If Pk ≥ 0: Select upper pixel, Pk+1 = Pk + 2Δy - 2Δx"
Advantages of Bresenham Algorithm?,"1. Uses only integer arithmetic
2. Faster than DDA
3. More accurate for lines and circles
4. No rounding required
5. More efficient"
Disadvantages of Bresenham Algorithm?,"1. Still produces non-smooth lines in some cases
2. More complex to understand than DDA"
DDA vs Bresenham: Arithmetic?,"DDA: Floating-point arithmetic
Bresenham: Integer arithmetic"
DDA vs Bresenham: Speed?,"DDA: Slower due to real arithmetic and rounding
Bresenham: Faster due to integer-only operations"
DDA vs Bresenham: Accuracy?,"DDA: Lower accuracy for curves/circles
Bresenham: Higher accuracy"
DDA vs Bresenham: Operations?,"DDA: Multiplication and division
Bresenham: Only addition and subtraction"
