## LECTURE 2: Video Display Devices

### 1. Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT)

#### Working Principle
- Electron beam emitted by electron gun
- Passes through focusing and deflection systems
- Hits phosphor-coated screen creating light spots
- **Refresh Rate**: 60-80 fps (frames per second)

#### Components
- Heater, Cathode, Control Grid
- First Anode, Second Anode
- Vertical and Horizontal Deflecting Plates
- Phosphor Screen

### 2. Display Types

#### Raster Scan Displays
- **Method**: Row-by-row scanning from top to bottom
- **Storage**: Picture information in refresh/frame buffer
- **Elements**: Individual picture elements called "pixels"
- **Advantage**: Good for realistic images

#### Random-Scan Displays (Vector Displays)  
- **Method**: Draws only required picture components
- **Storage**: Line-drawing commands in refresh display file
- **Advantage**: Efficient for line drawings
- **Limitation**: Cannot display realistic shaded scenes

### 3. Color CRT Methods

#### Beam-Penetration Method
- **Structure**: Layered phosphor (red outer, green inner)
- **Control**: Electron beam speed determines color
- **Colors**: Primarily red and green, limited range
- **Usage**: Limited applications due to color restrictions

#### Shadow-Mask Method
- **Structure**: Three electron guns (RGB)
- **Mechanism**: Shadow mask with precisely positioned holes
- **Advantage**: Wide color range, accurate color control
- **Usage**: Most common color CRT method

### 4. Storage Devices

#### Direct-View Storage Tubes (DVST)
- **Function**: Stores picture information in CRT
- **Advantage**: No refresh required for static images
- **Limitation**: Cannot selectively erase - must redraw entire screen
- **Usage**: Complex high-resolution static displays

### 5. Flat-Panel Displays

#### Emissive Displays (Convert electrical energy to light)

**Plasma Panel**:
- Gas mixture (neon + argon) between glass plates
- Ionized gas creates glowing spots
- Good brightness and viewing angle

**LED (Light-Emitting Diode)**:
- Diode matrix arrangement
- Fast, reliable, low power consumption
- Long life, lightweight

**Thin-Film Electroluminescent**:
- Electroluminescent material activation
- Good resolution capabilities

#### Non-Emissive Displays (Use external light)

**LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)**:
- Liquid crystals control light passage
- Requires backlight or external light
- Lightweight, low power
- Limited viewing angle

## LECTURE 3: Line Drawing Algorithms - DDA

### Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm

#### Purpose
Generate points between starting and ending coordinates of a line using incremental calculations.

#### Input Parameters
- Starting coordinates: (X₀, Y₀)
- Ending coordinates: (Xₙ, Yₙ)

#### Step 1: Calculate Basic Parameters
```
ΔX = Xₙ - X₀
ΔY = Yₙ - Y₀  
M = ΔY / ΔX (slope)
```

#### Step 2: Point Generation Cases

**Case 1: M < 1**
```
X₁ = X₀ + ΔX
Y₁ = Y₀ + M × ΔX
```

**Case 2: M ≥ 1**  
```
X₁ = X₀ + ΔY / M
Y₁ = Y₀ + ΔY
```

**Case 3: M = 1**
```
X₁ = X₀ + ΔX
Y₁ = Y₀ + ΔY  
```

**Case 4: M undefined (vertical line)**
Special handling for vertical lines

#### Step 3: Iteration
Repeat Step 2 until endpoint reached or step count completed.

#### Advantages
- Simple and easy to implement
- Fast incremental calculations
- Eliminates complex multiplications

#### Disadvantages  
- Uses floating-point arithmetic (slower)
- Requires rounding operations
- Less accurate for curves and circles
- Time-consuming due to rounding

## LECTURE 4: Line Drawing Algorithms - Bresenham

### Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm

#### Key Innovation
Uses **ONLY integer arithmetic** (addition and subtraction) instead of floating-point operations.

#### Working Principle
- Based on decision parameter to choose next pixel
- Compares distances from mathematical line
- Incremental approach with integer calculations

#### Decision Parameter
**Initial**: P₀ = 2Δy - Δx (for slope < 1)

#### Decision Rules
```
If Pₖ < 0:
    Select lower pixel
    Pₖ₊₁ = Pₖ + 2Δy

If Pₖ ≥ 0:  
    Select upper pixel
    Pₖ₊₁ = Pₖ + 2Δy - 2Δx
```

#### Algorithm Steps
1. Input line endpoints
2. Calculate Δx, Δy
3. Initialize decision parameter P₀
4. For each x position:
   - Plot current pixel
   - Update decision parameter
   - Choose next pixel based on Pₖ value
5. Repeat until line complete

#### Advantages
- Uses only integer arithmetic
- Faster execution than DDA
- More accurate for lines and circles  
- No rounding operations required
- More efficient overall

#### Disadvantages
- More complex to understand than DDA
- Still produces non-smooth lines in some cases
