Short Answer,Compare Raster Scan and Random Scan displays. (6 marks),"Raster Scan: Electron beam sweeps row by row, stores picture in frame buffer, good for realistic images, refresh entire screen
Random Scan: Draws only required lines, stores as line commands, good for line drawings, vector-based, cannot display shaded scenes",
Short Answer,Explain the working principle of CRT display. (5 marks),"CRT works by emitting electron beam from electron gun, passing through focusing and deflection systems to specific positions on phosphor-coated screen. Phosphor emits light when contacted by electron beam. Since light fades rapidly, picture must be refreshed repeatedly at 60-80 fps.",
Long Answer,"Implement DDA Line Drawing Algorithm step by step for drawing a line from (2,2) to (8,6). Show all calculations. (10 marks)","Given: (X0,Y0) = (2,2), (Xn,Yn) = (8,6)

Step 1: Calculate parameters
ΔX = 8-2 = 6
ΔY = 6-2 = 4  
M = 4/6 = 0.67

Step 2: Since M < 1, use Case 1
Points: (2,2) → (3,2.67)≈(3,3) → (4,3.33)≈(4,3) → (5,4) → (6,4.67)≈(6,5) → (7,5.33)≈(7,5) → (8,6)

Final points: (2,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,6)",
Long Answer,Compare DDA and Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithms in detail. (10 marks),"DDA Algorithm:
- Uses floating-point arithmetic
- Requires multiplication/division
- Slower due to rounding operations
- Less accurate for curves
- Simple to implement

Bresenham Algorithm:
- Uses only integer arithmetic
- Only addition/subtraction operations
- Faster execution
- Higher accuracy for lines and circles
- No rounding required
- More efficient overall

Conclusion: Bresenham is preferred for most applications due to speed and accuracy.",
Long Answer,Explain different types of Flat-Panel Displays with their advantages and disadvantages. (12 marks),"Emissive Displays:
1. Plasma Panel: Uses ionized gas, good brightness, wide viewing angle but high power consumption
2. LED: Fast, reliable, low power, long life but expensive for large displays
3. Thin-film Electroluminescent: Good resolution but limited color range

Non-Emissive Displays:
1. LCD: Lightweight, low power but limited viewing angle and requires backlight

Advantages: Lightweight, compact, low power
